Phishing is one of the most prevalent and dangerous cyber threats worldwide, affecting millions of users every year. Attackers create fraudulent websites that closely resemble legitimate sites, with the goal of stealing personal information, financial credentials, and sensitive data. Traditional blacklist-based and signature-based methods often fail because phishing URLs change rapidly and evolve to bypass conventional defenses.

This project proposes a machine learning driven phishing website detection system designed for global applicability. By extracting URL-based features such as length, entropy, domain age, presence of suspicious characters, number of subdomains, and keyword patterns, the model learns to distinguish between legitimate and malicious websites. The solution is scalable, lightweight, and can be integrated into browsers, email filters, and enterprise security tools.

The goal is to build a practical, real-world detection system that improves online safety and reduces phishing-related cybercrime across the world.
